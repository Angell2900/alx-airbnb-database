# Database Normalization Analysis

## First Normal Form (1NF)
- All tables have primary keys
- All columns contain atomic values
- No repeating groups

## Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Database is in 1NF
- No partial dependencies
- All non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key

## Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Database is in 2NF
- No transitive dependencies
- All columns are directly dependent on the primary key

## Implementation Details
1. User table: Already in 3NF as all attributes depend on user_id
2. Property table: In 3NF with property_id as primary key
3. Booking table: In 3NF with booking_id as primary key
4. Payment table: In 3NF with payment_id as primary key
5. Review table: In 3NF with review_id as primary key
6. Message table: In 3NF with message_id as primary key
