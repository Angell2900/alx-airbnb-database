Airbnb Clone Project
Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project aims to build a simplified version of the Airbnb platform — allowing users to list, browse, and book properties online. The project focuses on backend development, database design, and API integration, following real-world software engineering practices.

Project Goals:

Develop a functional and scalable accommodation booking system.
Implement user management, property listing, and booking features.
Design a secure and efficient backend using modern technologies.
Practice collaborative software development using GitHub workflows.

Tech Stack Summary:

Backend: Django (Python)
Database: PostgreSQL
API Layer: GraphQL / RESTful APIs
Deployment & CI/CD: Docker, GitHub Actions

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Team Roles
Role	Description
Project Manager	Oversees project timelines, communication, and deliverables. Ensures all team members are aligned with project goals.
Backend Developer	Designs and builds the server-side logic, APIs, and database interactions using Django.
Frontend Developer	Builds the user interface and connects it to the backend via APIs. Focuses on user experience and design.
Database Administrator (DBA)	Manages the PostgreSQL database, ensuring performance, normalization, and data integrity.
QA Engineer	Tests features and APIs, identifies bugs, and ensures the system meets functional requirements.
DevOps Engineer	Automates deployment using Docker and sets up CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions.
    
     
Technology Stack
Technology	Purpose
Django	A high-level Python web framework used to build robust backend APIs and manage server-side logic.
PostgreSQL	A powerful open-source relational database system used for storing user, property, and booking data.
GraphQL	Provides efficient data querying and interaction between frontend and backend.
Docker	Containerizes the application to ensure consistency across development and production environments.
GitHub Actions	Automates testing, building, and deployment processes as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
Python	The core programming language used throughout the backend logic and API development.
  
 
Database Design
Entity	Key Fields	Description
Users	user_id, name, email, password, role	Represents users who can either host or book properties.
Properties	property_id, host_id, title, location, price, availability	Represents the listings posted by hosts.
Bookings	booking_id, user_id, property_id, check_in, check_out, status	Stores booking information and dates.
Reviews	review_id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment, created_at	Contains user reviews for properties.
Payments	payment_id, booking_id, amount, status, payment_date	Handles transactions for confirmed bookings.

Relationships:

A User can host multiple Properties.
A Booking belongs to one User and one Property.
A Payment is linked to a single Booking.
A Review is written by a User for a Property.

Feature Breakdown
Feature	Description
User Management	Allows users to register, log in, update profiles, and manage roles (host or guest).
Property Management	Hosts can list, update, or remove their properties, including setting pricing and availability.
Booking System	Enables users to browse available properties, make reservations, and manage bookings.
Review System	Users can rate and review properties after their stay to enhance transparency and trust.
Payment Integration	Processes secure payments for confirmed bookings using third-party payment gateways.
Search and Filter	Users can search for properties by location, price, and amenities for a smoother experience.
  
API Security
Security Measure	Purpose
Authentication	Ensures that only registered users can access their accounts and data (via JWT tokens).
Authorization	Restricts certain actions to specific roles (e.g., only hosts can add properties).
Data Encryption	Protects sensitive user and payment data using SSL/TLS and password hashing.
Rate Limiting	Prevents abuse of API endpoints by limiting the number of requests per user.
Input Validation	Avoids SQL injection and XSS attacks by validating all user inputs.

Why Security Matters:
Protects user privacy and payment details.
Maintains platform integrity and trustworthiness.
Prevents unauthorized access and data breaches.


CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) ensures the project is automatically built, tested, and deployed whenever new code is pushed.

   Tools & Workflow:
GitHub Actions: Automates testing and deployment workflows directly from GitHub.
Docker: Ensures consistent environments for development, testing, and production.



CI/CD Benefits:

Faster and more reliable updates.
Early bug detection.
Reduced human error in deployments.

Summary

This project simulates real-world development practices by combining backend engineering, database design, and DevOps. By the end of the Airbnb Clone, you’ll have hands-on experience with full-stack architecture and team collaboration workflows used in professional software environments.
